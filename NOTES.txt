To launch your React app from a VPS, follow these steps:

Access your VPS:
ssh your_username@your_vps_ip

Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

Clone your React app repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository

Install the dependencies:
npm install

Build your React app:
npm run build

Install a web server to serve your React app (e.g., serve):
npm install -g serve

Serve your React app:
serve -s build

(Optional) Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx:
Install Nginx:
sudo apt install nginx

Configure Nginx to serve your React app. Edit the Nginx configuration file:
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Add the following configuration:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_ip;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

Restart Nginx:
sudo systemctl restart nginx

Your React app should now be accessible from your VPS.
