        <p>I sincerely apologize if you are seeing this page as <e>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</e>.</p>
        <p>I will have the content up as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>I am an aspiring software developer in Dayton, OH.  I am currently attending Sinclair Community College
            for an Associates of Science in Software Development.  I am a graduate of LaunchCode's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
            I am well versed in C++ and Java with strong experience in Python and C#.
            I am always coding and working on a project(s) from a home Google Wall Calendar & Server to automating my garden/plants to
            building tube amps and radios (Ham enthusiast, I). I am also a musician writing, recording and (covid pending) performing.
            I hope to enter the software field working on mission critical systems, embedded systems, operating systems, and systems in general.
            There is no project or problem I would not enthusiastically take on.
            I am also always excited for meetups, collaboration on projects, hackathons, etc.
