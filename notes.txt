=======================================================================================
This error message indicates that there was an attempt to stop a Caddy instance using its API, but the connection to the API endpoint at `http://localhost:2019/stop` was refused. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The Caddy server is not running.
2. The Caddy server is not listening on the expected port (2019).
3. There is a network issue preventing the connection to the localhost on port 2019.
4. The API endpoint is incorrect or not available.

To resolve this issue, you can:

1. Ensure that the Caddy server is running by checking its status with `sudo systemctl status caddy`.
2. Verify that Caddy is configured to listen on port 2019 for API requests.
3. Check for any firewall rules or network configurations that might be blocking the connection.
4. Review the Caddy configuration file to ensure the API endpoint is correctly set up.

You can also manually stop the Caddy server using the command:
